          I'm a <strong>computer engineering student</strong> at <u>University of Bologna</u>, passionate about <strong>game development</strong> and <strong>game design</strong>. <br /><br />
          Growing up playing videogames, I was always fascinated by the complexity and the team work that lies behind the making of a game.
          When I'm not studying, I'm always writing down or drawing new project ideas. In my spare time I love making pixel art, listening to music, photography, going to the cinema,
          gaming and reading books (mainly about physics or narrative). 
          Excited to contribute to innovative and engaging game experiences in the future.

          I have experience with several programming languages, including <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, and <strong>Lua</strong>.  
          <br /><br />
          I primarily work in <strong>Unity</strong> for game development, and use <strong>Git</strong> for version control and collaboration.  
          <br /><br />
          For the design side of my projects, I enjoy creating assets with tools like <strong>Procreate</strong>, <strong>Aseprite</strong>, and <strong>Figma</strong>, which allow me to bring a unique visual style to my games and prototypes.
